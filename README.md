# DOTFILES (ZSH)

## This repo is mostly for me. Lots of things taken from: [mathiasbynens dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) and [paulirish dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles)

### Warning: This will blow out your old dotfiles

- Install: Clone it, run the setup script `./setup.sh`
